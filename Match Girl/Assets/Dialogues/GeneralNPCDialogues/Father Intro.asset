        tops of the Bryant and May Factory. That\u2019s where your older sister has
        been working for these past few weeks. And up ahead, you can\u2019t quite
        see it from here, but a little ways around the corner you would find my new
        workplace."

    - entryText: "Right my dear. Railroad ties. I\u2019ll be there most days from
        now on. And you, my child, we are going to find a nice little shop somewhere
        for you to start helping out and earning some money yourself. Maybe Mr. Woodgate
        is looking for a helper at the bakery."

    - entryText: "I\u2019ll talk to him tonight on my way home. Maybe I can pick up
        a little flour too with my first wages and we can make some bread to celebrate.
        Now get yourself back home and watch after your little brother."
