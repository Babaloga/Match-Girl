      - I'm sure I haven't sir. I'm just here to sell matchboxes! Bryant and May's,
        would you be interested?
      - Sorry sir, I've never met a Gladstone! Perhaps Constable Woodson over there
        knows where he went!
      - I thought the Marquess of Salisbury was Prime Minister. I've never heard of
        Mr. Gladstone!
    - entryText: Bah, he probably forgot all about it again. That man can't hardly
        tell a stage-coach from a workhouse! But matches, you say? Oh he understands
        those just well enough! Give me a box of the finest Lucifers!

      - Of course! Here you are, sir!
      - Er, actually sir I don't think any of these matches are fit for a Prime Minister.
        You'll have to look somewhere else!
    - entryText: An excellent idea, Gertrude! The Constable and I are men of the same
        amiable manner! Perhaps he also knows the way down to Old Nichol.

        raze the world, but I've seen that foozler for what he is! Gladstone, now,
        there's a real gentleman! Knows how to turn and cut like no man I've ever
