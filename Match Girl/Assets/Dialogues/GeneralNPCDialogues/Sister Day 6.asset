        single match girl is out on the street protesting. I\u2013I don\u2019t know
        if this will work but they can definitely hear us now! I\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.
        With the factory closed, I\u2019m without work. But maybe...if you can keep
        bringing money in, I think we might stand a chance of actually changing something
        for the better! I have to go now but please, Phoebe, you must be strong enough
        for the whole family."
