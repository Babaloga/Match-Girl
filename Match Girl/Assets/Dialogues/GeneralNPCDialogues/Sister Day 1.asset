        fine me. This is your overseer, Mister Williams. He\u2019s agreed to watch
        after you out here. You\u2019ll be selling the same matches that I\u2019m
        making just inside this factory. We\u2019ll be like partners! And at the end
        of the day, we can meet here and walk home together."

        we can buy you some thicker shoes once you bring home a little money. Still,
        you\u2019ll want to keep near these lamps to stay warm out here. Now I really
        must get back. Speak with Mister Williams and he will prepare you for your
        day. Good luck!"
