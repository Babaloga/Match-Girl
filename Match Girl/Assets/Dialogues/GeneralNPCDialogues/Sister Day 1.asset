        fine me. When we get to the Old Ford Road find your overseer, Mister Williams.
        He\u2019s agreed to watch after you out here. You\u2019ll be selling the same
        matches that I\u2019m making just inside the Bryant & May Factory. We\u2019ll
        be like partners! And at the end of the day, we can walk home together."

        we can buy you some thicker shoes once you bring home a little money. Still,
        you\u2019ll want to keep near these lamps to stay warm out here. We're almost
        there now. Remember to approach Mister Williams and press SPACE to get his
        attention. He will prepare you for your day. Good luck!"
