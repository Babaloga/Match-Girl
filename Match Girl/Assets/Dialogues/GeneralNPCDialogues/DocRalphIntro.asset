        we could hope for. I\u2019m sorry, you all must be going through a lot. Did
        you find some money for the bandages? I also have a wide array of tonics and
        cures that may be able to aid his recovery. And...well, I read in a medical
        magazine the other day about the antiseptic properties of carbolic acid. I
        don\u2019t know where you\u2019d find it, but I know it\u2019s used to treat
        the sewage water in the city. Perhaps you could find some to treat your father\u2019s
        wound."

        it will work in every case, but we can always try another remedy.'
